# Upgrade AlignFirst to v3

This prompt detects your current AlignFirst version (v1 or v2) and runs the appropriate migration.

> **Note**: Commands shown are Unix-style. Adapt to your OS if needed (e.g., PowerShell on Windows).

## Step 1 — Prerequisites

1. If this is a git repository, verify the working tree is clean. **Do not proceed with uncommitted changes.**

2. Verify you have access to the **docfront** skill. If you don't, stop and tell the user:

   > "I don't have access to the docfront skill. Please install it first:
   >
   > ```bash
   > npx skills add paleo/docfront --skill docfront
   > ```"

3. Verify the **docfront CLI** is available (e.g., check if `package.json` has a `docfront` script, or try running `npx docfront --help`). If not available, stop and tell the user:

   > "The docfront CLI is not installed in this project. Please install it first — ask your agent:
   >
   > ```text
   > Use your docfront skill. Install docfront CLI in this project.
   > ```"

## Step 2 — Ensure Ticket ID Section

Check if `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` exists. If one exists, use it as the INSTRUCTION_FILE. If neither exists, create `AGENTS.md`.

Check if the INSTRUCTION_FILE already contains an `## AlignFirst - Ticket ID` section. If it does and it looks correct, skip ahead. Otherwise:

1. Look at git branches (`git branch -a`) to detect a ticket ID format (e.g., `ABC-###`, `PROJ-###`, or numeric).
2. If no pattern is found, ask the user:

   > "I couldn't detect a ticket ID format from the branch names. Please provide the ticket ID format (e.g., "numeric", `ABC-###`, etc.)"

3. Add (or fix) this section in the INSTRUCTION_FILE:

   > ## AlignFirst - Ticket ID
   >
   > _Ticket ID_: Format is `{DETECTED_FORMAT}`. Use the ticket ID if explicitly provided. Otherwise, deduce it from the current branch name (no confirmation needed). If the branch name is unavailable, get it via `git branch --show-current`. Only ask the user as a last resort.

## Step 3 — Detect Version

**Check for v1**: Look for `_docs/alignfirst/`, `_docs/vibe-flow/`, or `_docs/ai-workflow/` directory.

**Check for v2**: Search for `alignfirst/SKILL.md` in any of these skills directories:

- `.claude/skills/`
- `.codex/skills/`
- `.github/skills/`
- `.cursor/skills/`
- `.gemini/skills/`
- `.agent/skills/`

**Important**: Ignore directories inside dependencies (`node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `venv/`, `.venv/`, `target/`, `build/`, `dist/`, etc.).

## Step 4 — Route

- **If v1 detected**: Fetch and follow **[upgrade-from-v1.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paleo/alignfirst/refs/heads/main/migrations/upgrade-from-v1.md)**.
- **If v2 detected**: Fetch and follow **[upgrade-from-v2.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paleo/alignfirst/refs/heads/main/migrations/upgrade-from-v2.md)**.
- **If neither**: Stop and tell the user:

  > "This project doesn't appear to have AlignFirst v1 or v2 installed. Use the installation instructions instead."
